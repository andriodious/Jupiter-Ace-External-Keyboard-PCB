# Jupiter-Ace-External-Keyboard-PCB

Allows an external keyboard to be built for a Jupiter Ace micro. Inspiration for this board came from:
https://www.jupiter-ace.co.uk/custom_aces_CN_IBMACE.html

The measurements for this keyboard allow the fitting of Cherry Part Number: MX1A-L1NN key switches.

The board has also been fitted into a DK-Tronics keyboard case : https://t-lcarchive.org/dktronics-keyboard/
